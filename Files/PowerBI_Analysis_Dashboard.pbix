## 🛠️ Steps to Build the Dashboard

### **1️⃣ Data Import & Preparation**
- Imported `sales_data.csv` into Power BI.
- Checked data types and ensured correct formatting.
- Transformed `OrderDate` into **Date/Time format** for time-based analysis.
- Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values.

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Created **calculated columns**:
