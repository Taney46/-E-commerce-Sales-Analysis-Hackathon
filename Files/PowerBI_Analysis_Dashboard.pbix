## 📊 Overview
This document outlines the process of building a Power BI dashboard for the **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Hackathon**. The dashboard visualizes key insights from the dataset, including **sales trends, customer behavior, and order fulfillment metrics**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify **top-selling products and high-revenue categories**.
- Analyze **sales trends over time** to determine peak shopping periods.
- Assess **customer demographics (gender, age, region) and their impact on purchasing behavior**.
- Evaluate the **order fulfillment rate** (delivered vs. returned orders).

## 📂 Dataset Used
- **File Name:** `sales_data.csv`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `CustomerID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Region`
  - `ProductName`, `Category`, `UnitPrice`, `Quantity`, `TotalPrice`
  - `ShippingStatus`, `OrderDate`

## 🛠️ Steps to Build the Dashboard

### **1️⃣ Data Import & Preparation**
- Imported `sales_data.csv` into Power BI.
- Checked data types and ensured correct formatting.
- Transformed `OrderDate` into **Date/Time format** for time-based analysis.
- Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values.

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Created **calculated columns**:
  - `TotalRevenue = UnitPrice * Quantity`
  - `AverageShippingFee = AVERAGE(ShippingFee)`
- Used **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to compute revenue by category and region.

### **3️⃣ Creating Visualizations**
✅ **Total Revenue Overview** → KPI Card displaying total revenue.
✅ **Sales by Region** → Donut Chart showing revenue per region.
✅ **Top-Selling Products** → Bar Chart ranking best-selling products.
